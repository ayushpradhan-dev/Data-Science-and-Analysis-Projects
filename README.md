# Ayush Pradhan - Data Science & Analytics Projects

Welcome to my **Data Science & Analytics Portfolio**!  
This repository contains a collection of my **data science, machine learning, and analytics projects**, demonstrating my ability to **analyze data, build predictive models, and derive insights using Python, R, and SQL**.  

Each project includes **code, documentation, and datasets (where applicable)** to provide a comprehensive overview of the problem tackled and the methodologies applied.

### **Retail Sales Analysis & Predictive Modeling**
** Project Scope:**  
Analyzed sales data to measure the impact of a **new store layout and signage** on revenue.  
** Dataset:** `sales.csv` (Located in the `data/` folder of this repository).  
** Implementation:**  
- Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using **histograms, scatter plots, and boxplots** to visualize sales trends.  
- Built a **multiple linear regression model in R** to measure the statistical significance of layout changes.  
- Controlled for **store type and staff turnover** to ensure accurate insights.  
- Validated assumptions using **residual analysis, variance inflation factors, and Durbin-Watson test**.

## Projects Overview

### **COVID-19 Data Analysis & Visualization**
** Project Scope:**  
Analyzed the impact of COVID-19 over time using real-time public API data.  
** Dataset:** Queried directly from a public COVID-19 API (no static dataset required).  
** Implementation:**  
- Extracted **real-time COVID-19 case, death, and vaccination data** from a **public API**.  
- Cleaned and structured the data into **Pandas DataFrames** for analysis.  
- Conducted **time-series analysis**, computing **rolling averages** and tracking infection trends.  
- Created **dynamic visualizations** to display **regional trends and patterns over time**.

### **Natural Language Processing (NLP) on Wikipedia Data**
** Project Scope:**  
Applied NLP techniques to extract meaningful insights from Wikipedia articles on **ACM Turing Award winners**.  
** Dataset:** Scraped using **WikiData & Wikipedia APIs**.  
** Implementation:**  
- Retrieved text from Wikipedia using **API queries**.  
- Preprocessed text using **tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stopword removal**.  
- Extracted **bigrams & trigrams** to identify frequent keyword associations.  
- Visualized **word distributions** with **Matplotlib** to compare linguistic patterns across award winners.

### **Handwritten Digit Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
** Project Scope:**  
Developed a **deep learning model** to classify handwritten digits with high accuracy.  
**Dataset:** **MNIST dataset** (70,000 images of handwritten digits).  
** Implementation:**  
- Built a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using **TensorFlow/Keras**.  
- Implemented layers including **convolutional, pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers**.  
- Optimized performance through **hyperparameter tuning** and **batch normalization**.  
- Achieved **high accuracy on unseen test data** through fine-tuning of the network.
